The provided Python code implements a basic reservation and billing system for a hotel or similar establishment.
The system includes functionalities such as ordering food, booking tables, registering for events, booking rooms, and generating bills.It is organized into classes, each handling a specific aspect of the overall system.

	Here's a brief overview of the main components:
	
	BillingSystem Class:
	
		Manages the generation of bills, including order totals, table costs, event costs, and room costs.
		Provides options for payment, such as credit card and cash.
		Validates credit card information (placeholder logic).
	
	TableBooking Class:
	
		Handles the booking of tables, including checking availability, collecting date and time details, and calculating costs.
	
	EventRegistration Class:
	
		Manages the registration for various events with associated costs.
	 
	RoomBookingSystem Class:
	
		Allows users to book rooms by specifying check-in and check-out dates, selecting room types, and displaying available options.
	 
	MenuSystem Class:
	
		Displays a menu with food items and prices for users to choose from.
	 
	TableBookingSystem Class:
	
		Implements a more advanced table booking system with the ability to display available tables, current reservations, and book tables based on date and time.
	 
	Main Function:
		
		Integrates the various components into a cohesive system.
		Uses a menu-driven approach, allowing users to interact with different features of the system.

 
Note: The code provided has some inconsistencies and duplicate class names, which may need to be addressed for the entire system to function correctly. Additionally, the credit card validation logic is a placeholder and should be enhanced for a real-world application.
